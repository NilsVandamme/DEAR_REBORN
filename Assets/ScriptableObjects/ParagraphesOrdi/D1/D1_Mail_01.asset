      personal secretary.\n\nWe contacted your services three days ago upon request
      from Ms.Nerium herself. She did write personally her letter.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>She received your answer, and read it.\n\nShe
      was majorly pleased. However, she did not appreciate the allusions you made
      about her \u2018ambition\u2019, or \u2018overconfidence\u2019.\n\nWe won\u2019t
      contact Dear Incorporated\u2019s chairman (who\u2019s a second-degree relation
      to Ms.Nerium via acquaintances, most of them being State officials), despite
      we could. </color></link>"

      any way with your life, as you still accomplished your task with honesty, despite
      being inept with your wording.</color></link>

      you to know that she\u2019ll maybe ask for your services once again, as long
      as you stay \u2018that way\u2019 (sic).</color></link>"
