  - partText: <link="D"><color=#7F4428ff></color></link>
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve heard that I have missed
      you while taking a few days off far from Capital City? Apparently, I was near
      your district.\n\nThat\u2019s too bad\u2026 Since our last letter, a few things
      happened. It would have been good to talk about that.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>We have a common acquaintance, you and
      me. Well, at least I have an acquaintance that is linked to your job. He\u2019s
      the one that informed me that you lived there.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B0\"><color=#7F4428ff>... Haha, don\u2019t be afraid. If we
      got interested in your person, that\u2019s because you seem to be trustworthy.
      And an ally at Dear Inc. could be very useful.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>You know, this month is gonna be full
      of surprises, leading all of the Nation\u2019s citizens to a brighter future.
      I hope. It seems that people are slightly waking up. And if my own very defaults
      prevent me from helping them, then so be it. I feel like I\u2019m not the only
      one that wants everyone to acquire true personal freedom.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B1\"><color=#7F4428ff>Even if I can talk freely here, since
      our common acquaintance made sure that your mailbox was safe, I\u2019ll let
      you carry on your task. I know you\u2019ll do just fine. I just wanted to give
      you a bit of a hint about our intentions.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>Yes, because I\u2019m not alone: I\u2019m
      working with big independent radios & news networks, like WokePress.Org. You
      know, that huge media, led by Dan Herault. Even if the man kinda seems like
      a bit of an opportunist to me, he\u2019ll be of great help. However, we have
      to find another associate. Someone that\u2019ll boost all of our potential influence
      on people. You know, getting funds, stuff like this\u2026\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>if you have an idea, like one of your
      clients that would seem open to a change in the current State\u2019s policies
      and acts\u2026 Then, feel free to contact me again\u2026 Until that, I\u2019ll
      try to work on my own defaults. I\u2019m still riddled with insecurities, too
      much to become a leader.\nI need to help a trusty person to become one.</color></link>"
