  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>Hey, so this is my second time writing
      to your team\u2026\nUuh last time I talked about how people around me behave
      weirdly. You know, because of my gender, and because I only seem to meet nosy
      OR entitled people ^^\u2019\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\nWell my social life\u2019s still not
      that easy, but not for the same reasons anymore haha\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B0\"><color=#7F4428ff>Now everyone\u2019s talking about politics.
      At first that was just boring (even if I know we\u2019re all concerned huh !!
      But I'm just not into arguing) but now that\u2019s boring AND ominous !</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>And when your friends are split up between
      stable workers, and unemployed dissidents, well\u2026 Conversations are quickly
      heating up.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>And I feel like, if you\u2019re not engaged
      on something, ready to act all feral because of opinions, you\u2019ll end up
      rejected by the ones who have one. </color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B1\"><color=#7F4428ff>But I don\u2019t wanna get stepped on
      by people who think that shouting is the best way to be listened to !!!</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\n\nOkay, if things are gonna change,
      that\u2019s awesome, like, for everyone. Except maybe our current leaders, but
      I don\u2019t care about them ; everyone\u2019s full of neuroses, because of
      the Big Hack, and all the laws that followed.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\nBut how can we know that the current
      climate won\u2019t help mad people from getting power ? Since they're usually
      the ones who shout the loudest\u2026\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: <link="B2"><color=#7F4428ff>Lastly, a creepy dude told me that my gender
      made me closer to a perfect human being than the majority of the population.</color></link>
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff> He kept talking about how everything
      depends on harmony, rationality, similarities\u2026 That if everyone behaved
      the same, thought the same, everything would go well.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\nBut him, or even my friends\u2026 They\u2019re
      all wrong\u2026 Beauty resides in contrasts, right ? In all our variety of personalities
      in differences ? What do you think of my situation, of all of this ? ^^</color></link>"
