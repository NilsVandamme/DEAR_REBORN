  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>!\n\nIt\u2019s your Dear (Inc. lol) sister
      again. Don\u2019t you know? There\u2019s been a great opening of some kind,
      just down my street! People cheering and applauding all over the place!\n\nI
      found out that\u2019s because the State\u2019s opening a Museum to record a
      lot of the huge events that shook the country since the two last decades.\n\nI
      mean, the Big hack was already more than ten years ago! That\u2019s crazy, right?\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>Everyone was terrified that their information
      would leak, or get sold on the internet. Or even worse, that the whole economy
      would downfall! And when the main State Computers went off... \nIt was really
      chaotic. </color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B0\"><color=#7F4428ff>Like, we went from an everyday life full
      of social media posts, memes, video games, and such, like\u2026 That, but with
      a slower connexion. And fewer connexion time also.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\nBut even if the government often seems
      like strict old men, they still care a bit about their inhabitants. it\u2019s
      good to see that there are still public places opening. I hope it\u2019ll boost
      the zone\u2019s activities, I wouldn\u2019t say no to a small nudge for my business..!\n\nWell,
      I\u2019ve got to bake stuff for tomorrow morning\u2019s clients. Remember to
      tell me about your day too!\n\nXoxo,\nYour aging big sis</color></link>"
