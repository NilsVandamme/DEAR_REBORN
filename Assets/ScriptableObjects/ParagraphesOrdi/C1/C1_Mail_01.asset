  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>Hello. This is Mr.S, again.\n\nI got your
      mail via the employee list, available online. Pretty surprising, when you know
      that you can\u2019t use social media for more than a couple hours per day. But
      it\u2019s a good thing because I am something important to say.\n\nThank you.\n</color></link>"

      Your advice about stress, anxiety all other neuroses that consumed me was just
      what I needed. The speech was a success. I actually managed to calm down despite
      being in front of a brand-new type of public. But people were really pleased.

  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\nYou made me realize that I desperately
      lacked confidence. It was that very lack that gave me all these insecurities.
      But, witnessing your investment despite I\u2019m a total stranger, is really
      heartwarming. I wasn\u2019t sure at all that Dear.Inc\u2019s services were genuine,
      and I didn\u2019t expect a lot when writing. But I did get a lot.\n\nPlease,
      keep being true to yourself.\n\nMr.S</color></link>"
