      as I named myself before.\nI just wanted  to deeply thank you for your help
      last time. Even without knowing me, you attempted to find the right words. And
      as everyone should know\u2026\n\n</color></link>"

      it takes to change the world.</color></link>
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>That time, you changed mine. Since the
      speech, I've been invited to numerous independent media, and I visit a lot of
      schools around the whole country. Apparently, people do need a change. There\u2019s

      of your industry.\n\n</color></link>"
