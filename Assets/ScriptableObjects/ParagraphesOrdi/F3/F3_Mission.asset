  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>I heard that your services
      were really successful those last weeks. It\u2019s probably because the whole
      country\u2019s unsure about its own future.\n</color></mark></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>\nI know things are hard
      for most people out there. I\u2019m at the top of Nerium Industries. And while
      climbing to the top, I witnessed slices of life, from various people with various
      fates... </color></mark></link>"
  - partText: <link="B0"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>And today, I have an uncanny
      influence on all of my acquaintances.</color></mark></link>
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff> I have the power to change
      my destiny, and change other\u2019s.\n\n</color></mark></link>"
  - partText: <link="B1"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>As a woman in the business
      industry, I often found myself lacking self-confidence, not raising my hand
      when I should have, or pulling back when I should have been leaning in.</color></mark></link>
  - partText: '<link="A"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff> But now, I''ve broken all
      those prejudices that used to hold me back.

  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>\nIt\u2019s actually a
      great time for new leader figures to come out. A time where everyone who\u2019s
      got a dream and a strong spirit can shine. A time where the tables can turn.

  - partText: "<link=\"B2\"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>How refreshing would
      it be to renew the old oligarchy that\u2019s been in place for years here ?</color></mark></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>\n\nI talked about it
      to my investors, and employees. I\u2019ve met several interesting profiles.\nPeople
      who wanted things to change. But I can also reach to all the students in the
      streets, or the analysts on media, to support them to bring out the truth. Well,
      even if the truth\u2019s subjective\u2026\n</color></mark></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>When the time comes, they\u2019ll
      all have a role then.\n</color></mark></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>\nBut when the time comes
      for what ? Well, that\u2019s why I came here to ask someone completely neutral,
      someone from the masses, to get advice. Which side should I pick ? What\u2019s
      the best for me, bringing in the renewal, a new era, or ensuring everything
      stays calm in the country ?\n</color></mark></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><mark=#A7DEFF00><color=#7F4428ff>\nI\u2019m counting on
      your advice to know how to behave. I\u2019m still expecting a lot from your
      services :-)</color></mark></link>"
