  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>!\nWho would have guessed that we\u2019d
      met that easily?\n\nI\u2019m not used to getting very far from Capital City.
      I\u2019m a born-and-bred Capitalian, and never lived outside the city. So, it
      was nice spending a few days in another region.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>It\u2019s also good to know that even
      if Dear Inc. is close to the State\u2019s because of its policies and your chairman\u2019s
      friendship with many important State bureaucrats, those honest citizens are
      still there, with the people, and for the people.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>I\u2019ve got in contact with Dan Herault,
      from Woke Press Org, a pretty huge independent newspaper. They also do clandestine
      radio shows, widely listened across the country. He told me that he needs to
      be sure about our abilities and that we have a true program with enough funding,
      to get the State attentive to our claims.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>However, we still need a small nudge to
      get us in front of the scene, and, of course, in the position of being listened
      to. until now, we have to play it cool so we won\u2019t bring the Harmony Forces
      attention to us.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B0\"><color=#7F4428ff>... Your company still isn\u2019t checking
      your personal mails, right? I know from a friend that normally, that wouldn\u2019t
      be the case.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: '<link="A"><color=#7F4428ff>

      Anyway. Keep up the good work.</color></link>'
