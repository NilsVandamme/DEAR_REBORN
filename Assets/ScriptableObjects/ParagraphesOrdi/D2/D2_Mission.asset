      ordinary people couldn\u2019t climb the social ladder. That despite every skill
      you might acquire, without the proper support, there was no chance for commoners
      to join the elite.\n\n</color></link>"

      and thoughtfulness. </color></link>

      I discovered that even with my abilities, I wouldn\u2019t ever reach a post
      of mere importance.\n\n</color></link>"

      earlier than my comrades, and of course that led to much jealousy. </color></link>"
  - partText: '<link="A"><color=#7F4428ff>But I didn''t care. I was the first one
      to get a promising job in the Nerium Industries, as an office worker. But because
      of the elites, I was never properly valued. Not a raise, in 8 years. Despite
      my ideas.

      of the future.\nI happened to witness Samwell Lowcey\u2019s speech at the National
      Culture Museum opening. I was baffled. First of all, this man can live his life
      as a \u2018free thinker\u2019 just by simply giving is opinion on various topics
      and people will applaud. </color></link>"

      I, too,want to do something big for our society. And I know that your company
      can help me ; I''ve investigated and found out that Mr.Lowcey sought your help.
