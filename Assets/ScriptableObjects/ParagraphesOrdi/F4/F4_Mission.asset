  - partText: '<link="A"><color=#7F4428ff>..Hello.


      This is Samwell Lowcey. I wrote under the nickname of Mr.S, last time.

  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>Since I gave this famous speech I sought
      your help for, things have been pretty unsettling.\nThe Harmony Forces were
      worried that I might be wanting to disturb peace in the country\u2026. Or mind-mastering
      future attacks, Big Hack-style\u2026 </color></link>"
  - partText: <link="B0"><color=#7F4428ff>Even though I have not the intent, nor the
      power to do something like that.</color></link>
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff> It would be disastrous for every citizen,
      even if it could bring the international community\u2019s attention over us.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\nI managed to get more traffic on my
      podcasts, and networks in general. People seem to like my ideas\u2026 But there\u2019s
      not enough interest to change anything on an upper scale. \n</color></link>"
  - partText: '<link="B1"><color=#7F4428ff>

      I feel alone. And vulnerable. </color></link>'
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff> Especially because of these letters I
      keep receiving. Always signed by names like \u2018an idealist\u2019, \u2018a
      free thinker\u2019, \u2018someone like you\u2019... </color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B2\"><color=#7F4428ff>I\u2019m getting the impression that
      someone\u2019s watching me.</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"CLyle1\"><color=#7F4428ff> I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s connected
      to the State or not\u2026 But what\u2019s sure is that I\u2019m not offered
      a lot of opportunities to organize public events anymore.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\nThe thing is\u2026 With those letters,
      I received a lot of confidential information\u2026\nMy anxiety has reached peaked
      level.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B3\"><color=#7F4428ff>\nI isolated myself from my family, because
      I feel like nobody really understands what\u2019s going on.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>What we\u2019re risking. I\u2019m starting
      to lose sight of what really matters. I\u2019m living with nothing but fears
      and dark thoughts.\nWhat\u2019s the right way to react, when all you know is
      slowly fading into the darkness ?\nWhat matters now ? How should I behave..?\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\n..Thanks for reading. Keep it low. That\u2019s
      the best thing you can do for both of us.</color></link>"
