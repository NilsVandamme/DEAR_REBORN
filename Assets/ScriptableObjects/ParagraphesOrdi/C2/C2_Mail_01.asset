      marks yet?\n\nI hope you\u2019re having more customers than me, even if I\u2019m
      not really worried. Dear Inc.\u2019s a pretty huge company, plus nowadays it\u2019s
      kinda the new personal internet for everyone. It\u2019s like having the power
      to read people\u2019s minds like a book haha\n\nwith lots of love,\nYour aging
