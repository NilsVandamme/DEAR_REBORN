  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>Hey. Since I got a quick answer last time
      i\u2019m writing again to your company. It\u2019s really great to have genuine,
      personalized answers. Made me think a lot. I\u2019ve sent a bunch of letters
      already, ah ah ah. My existence is entirely focused on those for now. Well,
      existence\u2026\nSometimes, I wonder if I even exist.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: <link="A"><color=#7F4428ff>To exist, people need either physical power,
      or spiritual one. In ancient times, people with spiritual power were generally
      working for some kind of deity. </color></link>
  - partText: "<link=\"B0\"><color=#7F4428ff>But now, God\u2019s name is Money. Actions.
      Votes. Or even Views.</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff> Those are hard to get. And since I'm
      no powerful alpha male either, I need to find other ways to exist in people\u2019s
      minds. Of gaining more spiritual power.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B1\"><color=#7F4428ff>Are you with me ? i\u2019m hard to follow,
      sometimes. I\u2019ve always had trouble communicating\u2026</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff> Even though I think that I\u2019m a people
      person. You know, my blood type\u2019s O- . Universal blood donor\u2026I\u2019m
      a philanthropist by nature.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>And the best I could do for society is
      helping itself to enhance. I mean, don\u2019t you agree ?\n</color></link>"
  - partText: <link="B2"><color=#7F4428ff>Imagine a world where everyone could use
      sheer rationality to analyze, and discuss everything.</color></link>
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff> Where you could reason anyone without
      being called a maniac. Where emotions wouldn\u2019t lead us, but education,
      and pragmatism would. And I'm not saying we need instruction, i\u2019m not talking
      about brainwashing ; we need education. The difference in matters of understanding
      is real.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>I\u2019ve recently closely followed Mr.Lowcey\u2019s
      activity. I want to know how he became renowned. I hope he\u2019ll soon teach
      me, and let me talk to people about my plans. I\u2019m very eager to find people
      who agree with my vision. And then, with enough support, I\u2019ll get to the
      top, and lead our Nation to evolution.\n\nCan I count on your company too ?
      Spread the word. Things are gonna change !</color></link>"
