      letter. You made very good points in it, especially about my personality.\n\nTherefore,
      I wrote to you again, regarding more concerns of mine. It\u2019s very pleasing

      to keep rational, and straightforward points nowadays. They lack rhetorics.

      people for debating and discussing with. But you, </color></link>"

      my phrasing, and formulas: I\u2019ve always expressed myself in a \u2018quirky\u2019
      way. But, in fact, I just choose my words wisely, so I can say exactly what
      I mean, and optimize my chances of being understood.\n</color></link>"
