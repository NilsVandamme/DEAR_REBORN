  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>Hello. It feels rather weird to write
      to your services, since I used to distrust them.\nBut I have no one to listen
      to my problems\u2026\nSee, i\u2019m a psychologist. Normally it\u2019s the other
      way around.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>But life here has been getting worse.
      I\u2019m not native to the Nation, I came here with my brother a decade ago\u2026
      Soon before the \u2018Big Hack\u2019 , so the laws weren\u2019t that\u2026 Rigid.
      Especially about foreigners. I attempted to find myself a job, and my brother
      too. </color></link>"
  - partText: '<link="B0"><color=#7F4428ff>We thought life here would be better than
      our birthplace.

      </color></link>'
  - partText: "<link=\"C\"><color=#7F4428ff>\nI thought I could get over the wary
      looks from the Harmony Forces when they did their \u2018monthly checks\u2019.</color></link>"
  - partText: '<link="A"><color=#7F4428ff> That it was just a transitory state because
      the country was in fear of new terrorist attacks.


      </color></link>'
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>I thought I could get over the raising
      weirdness of my clients. The omnipresence of control over technology usage and
      public services changed people's behaviors. I\u2019ve got a very uncanny feelings
      towards my clients. Like their personalities are all fading towards the same,
      bland one. Either that or madness.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>I thought I could get over my brother\u2019s
      disappearance. He used to work here, and was pretty secretive about it.  But
      a job this valued was a gift for us, so I understood. However it\u2019s been
      months now since he left your company, and left our house.\n\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B1\"><color=#7F4428ff>But apparently, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t
      go on.\n</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>Lastly, the State gave us special advices
      on how to treat a case, like they know my job.\nOn the same day, I\u2019ve had
      several people talking to me about their great destinies</color></link>"
  - partText: <link="A"><color=#7F4428ff></color></link>
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>I don\u2019t believe things will change.
      </color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"B2\"><color=#7F4428ff>I don\u2019t believe in anything any
      more.</color></link>"
  - partText: "<link=\"A\"><color=#7F4428ff>\n\nSo go on, Dear expert. Tell me. What
      should I do ? How should I feel ? When will it get better ? I\u2019ll wait.</color></link>"
